TODO web app that maintains tasks for user (settings can be changed according to use as daily task manager or monthly or annual todo) , created for participating in HackerEarth StackHack1.0

:cowboy_hat_face:

->our project with name TODO_Manager(can be used personal manager/assistant).

->we can further add functionality of budget planning etc with it also can add it with some chrome extensions for eg- for setting reminders!! :thinking:

We have not yet deployed it but prepared both front-end and back-end! (running out of time but are working on the same and will be back with the same soon!)

for running the system in your local environment follow the instructions:-
1) clone the repository in your local environment.
2) start command-line interface.
3) change path to the project directory.
4) run the project by command:- 'python manage.py runserver'.
5) on your browser open localhost:8000 to check out the apps functionality.



Next is explanation of files stack:-

->an django app named users(where we ahve placed all the template pages- registration, login, logout, home ie index).
