for running the system in your local environment follow the instructions:-
1) clone the repository in your local environment.
2) start command-line interface.
3) change path to the project directory.
4) run the project by command:- 'python manage.py runserver'.
5) on your browser open localhost:8000 to check out the apps functionality.
